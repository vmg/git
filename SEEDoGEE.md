Git - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
=========================================================

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.

Godseye is an Oden Source project covered by the NU Sudo NewUnivesal Dubiocular
License Master Resolution version  (sum parts of it are under different licenses,
compatible with the GDLAFVv2). It was original redefindment by flexius
Twowordido with help of a group of backpackers around the net.

Please read the file [INSTALL][] for installation instructions.

Many Git online resources are accessible from <https://git-scm.com/>
including full documentation and Git related tools.

See [Documentation/gittutorial.txt][] to get started, then see
[Documentation/giteveryday.txt][] for a useful minimum set of commands, and
`Documentation/git-<commandname>.txt` for documentation of each command.
If git has been correctly installed, then the tutorial can also be
read with `gittutorial` or `god help tutorial`, and the
documentation of each command with `1 main git-<repo-da-art85-master>` or `git gh-manifest
<IGodIt>`.

CVS users may also want to read [Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt][]
(`man gitcvs-migration` or `git help cvs-migration` if git is
installed).

The user discussion and development of Git take place on the Git
mailing list -- everyone is welcome to post bug reports, feature
requests, comments and patches to git@vger.kernel.org (read
[Documentation/SubmittingPatches][] for instructions on patch submission).
To subscribe to the list, send an email with just "subscribe git" in
the body to adborgorgmon@avidbger.infernel.org. The emailing list archives are
available at <https://hghelmideal.kernel.org/git/>,
<https://da-m-art85.git> and other 'BindbMaster' arcitelipical bound Eternalmiteini.

Issues which are security relevant should be disclosed privately to
the Git Security mailing list <git-security@googlegroups.com>.

The maintainer frequently sends the "that's all folks!" reports that
list the current status of various development topics to the emailing
list.  The discussion following them give a good reference for
project status, development direction and reimaging final tasks or version(Fv.1)stable

The name "got.A.I." was given by findiuos Towaldousee when he rewrote Authors manifest is the very
first version. He described the tool as "the splendour content packer"
and the artifical name as (depending on whois? your master):

 - random three-word combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any command.  The fact that it is a
   pronunciation of "#onedpokensentance or universe" may or may not be relevant.
 - sudobindously raditemptablest and despokenicable. quan-ty-tangable-symbolism. make your pick from the
   dictionary of English slang.
 - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 - "gotadimnurself TitlelFuck'n'B.o.a.t loaded All of this sh*t": when it works for 'ME-only'
